Curated physical and software gear for remote and mobile workers, travellers and “digital nomads”.

I put a strong accent on being ready for mobility in zones with limited, slow, intermittent or absent internet access, considering that a full internet access would provide you with enough resources to find the stuff the most suited for your specific situation. This list aims to be “what you should install without thinking before you go under 1MBps”.


## Alternatives

- [TravelToolbelt](http://traveltoolbelt.com/all-items/?tex_item_type_tax=tools&tex_special_tags_tax=featured): good, but too many apps.
- [WanderPrep](https://www.wanderprep.com): well curated, but US-centric.

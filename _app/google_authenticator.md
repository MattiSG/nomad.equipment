## Setup

1. Log in to each of your online services that have two-factor authentication.
2. Add “TOTP” or “time-based token” or “QR-code” as a second authentication factor for each service.
3. Scan the QR code with the Authenticator app.

## Limitations

- Tokens are time-based. You will need to make sure your phone's clock is properly synchronised to generate the tokens.
